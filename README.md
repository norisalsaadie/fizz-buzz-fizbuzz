# fizz-buzz

## Get started:
npm install and then npm start (it will call fizzBuzz with range 1-20)

## Tests
I'm using AVA test runner due to it's simple and fast API. To run it, use npm test

## Wallaby
If you are luck enough to use wallaby, then it should just work and you can view the output in your editor.

## Assumptions
1. The range will always start from 1, and range must be a valid integer.
2. It will run with a default range of 1-20.
3. The output will simply be a string.
4. Stay away from FP as I don't know the target audience
