# fizz-buzz

## Get started:
`npm install` and then `npm start` (it will call fizzBuzz with range 1-20)

## Tests
I'm using AVA test runner due to it's simple and fast API. To run it, use `npm test`

## Wallaby
If you are lucky enough to use wallaby, then it should just work and you can view the output in your editor.

## Assumptions
1. The range will always start from 1, and range must be a valid integer.
2. It will run with a default range of 1-20.
3. The output will simply be a string.
4. Stay away from FP as I don't know the target audience

## Total time
30 minutes for step(s) 1-3

## cli - bonus feature
Additional 5 minutes to provide the ability to pass in args to override range without code updates.
To use simple run `node index.js --range=100`

## Node version
Developed used node v7.10.0
